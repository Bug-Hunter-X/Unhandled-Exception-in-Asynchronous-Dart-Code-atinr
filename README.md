# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code: unhandled exceptions within `async` functions.  The provided example showcases how to properly handle exceptions using `try-catch` blocks and the `rethrow` keyword for more robust error management.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the initial error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides the corrected code.
